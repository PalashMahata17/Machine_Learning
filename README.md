# OBJECTIVE:
This is my MML project on the topic food wastage redistribution network. Basically the idea is that lots of food are getting wasted and thrown away everyday in dustbin in any occasion ,birthday party, corporate party and those food are literally dumped at a place creating many problems like:-
1. those extra food dumped at a place emits green house gases like methane which ultimatey pollutes the enviorment and is responsible for the ozone layer deplition.
   
2.Those extra food can be given to the persons in need those who are not even able to meet there basic everyday food requirement and also in a country like india with such a high population the problem of food wastage is a great social economic problem. 

3.We are basically trying to eradicate this problem by patreniring with the significant large caterer  to get the data where are those events happening and what are total food quantity of food prepared by them for the events.

4.we will also patner with the restaurant to know about there daily food peparation and extra food. 

5.With the help of this data that they will upload in an app that a extra food of this much quantity is available in this location and then the Ngo's helping those needy people can go to that place collectiong those extra food and help.
